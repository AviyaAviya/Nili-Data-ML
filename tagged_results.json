Clashes have also occurred in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and with Hezbollah along the Israel\u2013Lebanon\u2013Golan Heights border. The fifth war of the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict since 2008, it is part of the broader Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and the most significant military engagement in the region since the Yom Kippur War 50 years earlier.[108]\n",

    "text": "The war began when Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel on 7 October. An estimated 3,000 militants breached the Gaza\u2013Israel barrier and attacked Israeli civilian communities and military bases. Several thousand rockets were concurrently launched into Israel. During this attack, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, including 766 civilians and 373 security personnel.[ac] In addition, 251 Israelis and foreigners were taken captive into Gaza.[109] Hamas said its attack was in response to the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, as well as alleged threats to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners.[110][111][112][113][114]\n",

    "text": "After clearing militants from its territory, Israel responded by launching one of the most destructive bombing campaigns in modern history,[115][116] before commencing a large-scale ground invasion on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and releasing the hostages.[117][118] Since the start of the Israeli operation, more than 35,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed,[119] of which the UN estimates at least 56% are women and children.[120] 10,000 others are missing and presumed trapped under rubble.[37] The war has been the deadliest for Palestinians in the entire Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.[121] Nearly all of the strip's 2.3 million Palestinian population has been forcibly displaced,[122][123] and over one hundred thousand Israelis remain internally displaced.[124] Israel's tightened blockade cut off basic necessities and its attacks on infrastructure have led to a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, including a collapse of the healthcare system and an impending famine.[125] By early 2024, Israeli forces had damaged or destroyed more than half of Gaza's houses,[126] at least a third of its tree cover and farmland,[127][128] most of its schools and universities, in what has been called 'scholasticide',[129][130] hundreds of cultural landmarks,[131] and dozens of cemeteries.[132] Israel's ground invasion initially focused on northern Gaza, which it had reoccupied by January 2024. After a seven-day truce involving exchange of captives, Israel moved south to attack Khan Yunis on 3 December.[133] On 24 May, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel must immediately halt its Rafah offensive.[134]\n",
